Thread number set to 40
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 1
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Mass accuracy will be determined separately for different runs
Scan windows will be inferred separately for different runs
Protein inference will not be performed
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
Fixed-width center of each elution peak will be used for quantification
Interference removal from fragment elution curves disabled
Mass accuracy will be fixed to 1e-05 (MS2) and 1e-05 (MS1)

7 files will be processed
